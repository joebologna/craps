# Rules for Craps

Craps is a popular dice game often played in casinos, and it can seem complex at first due to its various betting options. Here’s a basic overview of the rules and gameplay:

### Basic Gameplay

1. **The Players**: Players take turns rolling two six-sided dice. The player rolling the dice is called the "shooter."

2. **The Come-Out Roll**: The game begins with the come-out roll. The shooter rolls the dice, and the outcome determines the next steps:

   - **Win**: If the shooter rolls a 7 or 11, they win.
   - **Lose**: If the shooter rolls a 2, 3, or 12, they lose (this is called "crapping out").
   - **Point**: If the shooter rolls any other number (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10), that number becomes the "point."

3. **Establishing the Point**: If a point is established, the shooter continues to roll the dice. The goal now is to roll the point number again before rolling a 7.
   - If the shooter rolls the point number again, they win.
   - If the shooter rolls a 7 before rolling the point number, they lose.

### Betting Options

1. **Pass Line Bet**: This is the most common bet. Players win on a come-out roll of 7 or 11 and lose on 2, 3, or 12. If a point is established, players win if the point is rolled again before a 7.

2. **Don't Pass Bet**: This is the opposite of the Pass Line Bet. Players win on a come-out roll of 2 or 3 and lose on 7 or 11. A roll of 12 is a push (no win, no loss). If a point is established, players win if a 7 is rolled before the point.

3. **Come Bet**: Similar to the Pass Line Bet, but it can be made after the point is established. The next roll acts as a new come-out roll for this bet.

4. **Don't Come Bet**: Similar to the Don't Pass Bet, but made after the point is established.

5. **Odds Bets**: After a point is established, players can place additional bets behind their Pass Line or Don't Pass bets. These bets pay true odds and have no house edge.

6. **Place Bets**: Players can bet on specific numbers (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10) to be rolled before a 7.

7. **Field Bets**: A one-roll bet that wins if the next roll is 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, or 12, and loses on 5, 6, 7, or 8.

### Additional Rules

- **Rolling the Dice**: The shooter must roll the dice so that they hit the back wall of the table.
- **Winning and Losing**: Bets are settled after each roll, and players can place new bets at any time.
- **Payouts**: Different bets have different payouts, and players should familiarize themselves with these before playing.

### Conclusion

Craps can be a fast-paced and exciting game, and while the rules may seem complicated at first, they become easier to understand with practice. It's always a good idea to observe a few rounds before participating to get a feel for the game.
